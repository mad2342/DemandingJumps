# DemandingJumps

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Jumping incurs a penalty to hitting targets depending on attackers weight class (configurable) AND adds one bar of stability damage. Jumping optionally disables called shots.

## Gameplay changes
* Introduces a configurable penalty to hit for jumping attackers
  * Depending on weight class by default
* Jumping adds instability to the performing actor
  * Depending on piloting expertise this can quickly result in unsteady Mechs upon landing, leaving the unit much more vulnerable (as evasion is canceled)
  * No hopping behind enemy mechs all day without a penalty anymore.
* Disallows called shots for units that jumped
  * Optional

## Why
I found myself beating everything the OpFor throwed at me with jump/backstabbing tactics, especially once Firestarters and Grasshoppers were available.
That seemed unreasonable for me, so i wanted to at least raise the risks involved when doing so.
